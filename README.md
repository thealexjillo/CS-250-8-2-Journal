    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I can interpret user needs by translating them into clear, testable requirements through user stories. A user story describes the feature from the end-users perspective, it also provides the team some form of acceptance criteria that defines "success". This process really ensures that I can stay focused on solving what the user actually wants implemented, and not just taking guesses on how to serve their needs. It also gives me (as a developer) concrete ways to measure when my task is completed, and helps protects me against scope changes/ creep. 

    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development with an iterative mindset, focusing on delivering value in small working increments. Some Agile processes I hope to continue to incorporate into my work would be sprints, stand ups and backlog refinement. More importantly, I think being involved with retrospectives would also be very fulfilling. Being able to refine and improve my teams workflow and processes sounds like a task I would be super passionate about.

    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means a lot more than just writing good code. To me, being a good team member means having good communication, empathy, accountability, and a sense of camaraderie. This means timely and thoughtful communication, support, balancing work loads, and ultimately it's all about setting up one another to succeed.
